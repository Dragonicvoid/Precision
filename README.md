A first person puzzle game where you have to kill your target.

How to play:
1. Select a level
2. Indentify the target by reading the mission detail on the pause menu
3. Shoot the target by calculating wind and distance (positive is right, negative is left)
4. Be careful to not shoot another person as that would make you lose the game
